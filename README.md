_j JavaScript Library
=====================

## What is it
_j is a very fast, general purpose functional dom manipulation library. It is a collection of functions to help manipulating web pages, making ajax request, and do simple animations. It focuses on staying close to be vanilla JavaScript without any magic objects. All selectors return true JavaScript arrays of dom elements, it does not wraps the results into a special objects. No chaining supported beyond what JavaScript supports.
